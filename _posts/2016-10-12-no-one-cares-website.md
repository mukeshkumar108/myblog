<p class="p-intro">So you've just spent the last few days fighting with your designer. Making the the logo that slight bit bigger. Getting that headline to stand out, to "pop"  off the page.</p> 

The last few weeks have been a battle, but its been totally worth it. 

Your website is finally live.

Sure it took way longer than first planned. 

Sure you spent way longer than planned. And it was hard convincing the designer to do what you wanted.

But it's here. 

And it's looking exactly the way you want it to look. 

Even you're mum said it looked great. 

But there's a problem.

It's been over a week now, and there's no new enquiries, no new leads, not even the tiniest pip from the telephone. 

You pick up the phone just to check it's still working. You hear the ring tone.  

You open your inbox. 

Nothing.

You post another twitter update, "Check out my new website". 

You post on Facebook again - "I've re-launched my website". Just to remind people.

A week later. Nothing.

"Why is no-one coming to the new website?"

###The Cold Hard Truth

The truth is... no one cares. 

<figure class="inline-img"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/14244D3GP0ntHW/giphy.gif" /></figure>

They don't care you've got twenty images that scroll past at lightning speed. The don't care your logo changes colour every second.

They don't care how much time you spent fighting with your designer bending his work to your particular requirements. They don't care about your mission statement. Or the fact you've posted on Facebook every hour  of every day for the past week. 

But wait...

I'm a developer - don't I build websites for a living? Shouldn't I be selling you the benefits of having a professionally designed website, and the glorious miracles that'll occur as a result of it?

You've heard a million times the importance of having a beautiful website. That it's the crux of your customers experience - the first impression of your business.  

Yes, and yes. But it's a little more deeper than that.

You see - the way a website looks is important. Within a split-second - they've making a judgement call about you, about your business. That first impression - that first second, will decide whether they'll spend another few seconds reading what you've got to say.

But underneath all that shiny exterior, they'll see the content. The meat. the purpose of your site.

You see, no one comes to your site to admire it like a beautiful piece of art (unless you're a bit of a geek like me, and geek out on stuff like that). 

The only reason you're stressing out over pixel-perfection is because you're emotionally invested in it. Trust me, your prospects, most visitor's to your site -they're not. They won't notice. And they simply don't care.  

###"WIIFM?"

But visitors to your site DO care...

They care about themselves! 

They care about finding a solution to their problem! 

When someone searches the internet, they're looking for an answer. An answer to their question. 

When someone comes to your webiste - they've probably got a question or two in mind. And they want to know whether you're the right person to help thm.

So when you spent all that time debating on the number of pictures you wanted including in your site, did you actually stop to think about why that slider's there in the first place?

###Have a Purpose

Step back, and ask yourself - what is the purpose of this page? What do I want the visitor to do next?

Make it easy - clear, and simple. 

You're guiding the visitor. Do you want them to call you? If so, is the number clearly visible? Can they click it and the phone automatically starts ringing? Are your opening hours clearly visible?

###Why does your site exist?
Your site has a purpose. And that purpose should be very clear. Every page on your site exists for a reason. Hopefully, it helps, and guides the user. Adds value to their life.

There's a million and one websites (and counting0 out there. There's probably a bajillion people doing the same thing you;'re doing. 

Either - your website can act as a tool - highlighting that 

Making statements like we care and value our customers are bullshit if you don't act on it. Tell me, do you think it adds value t


Please for the love of god, don't start posting and spamming social media with posts about your new website. Seriosuly - no one cares.

If a freidn boutght a new car, and all they did was post pictures saying come check out my new car you'd think they were a dick.

So why do it with your website?

your customers, your prospects, ur target audience - like you - they're busy/ 

What do you think going to happen - they come to your website and go well done? How does that help your business? How does that provide value to your prospects lives?

Write a post that'll help a prospect, and share that... 

Has your webiste been n exercise to indulge your creative dreams - ignoring your designers advice so you get to make ridiculous choices on colours and fonts. There's probably a reason you're not a designer... Don't waste your time pretending to be one. 

Use the chance of a new website to think carefully how you can address your customers pain points, and provide value int heir lives. think abou the user - htey're struggles and address those. Display your subject expertise by writing content that helps your customers. Not only will it help someone, it can get shared, and maybe attract other leads to you/

What do you expect someone to do when they come to your site? Oh beautiful site - right I'm going to be a customer? No - chances are the site is all about you. What you do, what you want to say, why you're so great. nd that reason forms part of your whole site's purpose. 

Do this, and do this first. And only then, should you spend some time talking about what colours and fonts you like.
