<p class="p-intro">I'm big into self-improvement: becoming a better version of myself, a better person, a better parent, a better developer, a better designer, and of course, creating a better business for myself.</p>

This here, my personal blog will capture my learnings along my journey: from meditation, to self-improvement, to adventures in the Front-End and Wordpress, to navigating the constantly evolving digital landscape. 

<h2 class="h3">Who Am I</h2>

Hi, my name's Mukesh, and I'm the face behind this blog. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dist/images/myface.jpg" alt="Mukesh Kumar" />

I run a small, boutique creative digital agency, [Craft Digital](http://www.craft-digital.co.uk) where I help ambitious brand-owners, change-makers and aspiring market-leaders better connect and engage with their audience through user-centred design, and inbound marketing. 

<h2 class="h3">Stalk Me Online</h2>

If you want, you can find all over the interwebz - [CodePen](http://codepen.io/mukeshkumar/) where I sometimes play around with Code, and share snippets, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/craft_digital) where I actively share the best articles from around the Web mainly on UX, digital strategy, and content marketing, [Pinterest](), [LinkedIn](), [SnapChat](), and obviously [Facebook]() too. 

<h2 class="h3">Follow My Journey</h2>

And as I share my learnings, my thoughts, and my opinions, I'd be super-excited (& downright honoured) if you decide to join me.
