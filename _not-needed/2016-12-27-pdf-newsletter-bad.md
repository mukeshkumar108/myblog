It's nearly 2017, so why on earth are you sending your company newsletter as a PDf attachement? 

It alwsy astounds me when I see small companies, or small local non-profits do this. And it's a clear sign of someone who's not in touch with the ever-chaning digital reality.

Maybe this worked 10 years ago. Many companies did it. But now? It's nearly 2017. What better way to show the world that you don't underatdn the reality of todays environment.

Look - i get it. Sometimes - there is a real reaosn for this. If the information contained is meant to be secure, and confidential - and not for public ocnusmption, then PDF's are a great way to distribute that content.

But outside of that, there's very little reason for you to do it.

55% of email is now, first opened on a mobile device (Litmus “Email Analytics” - March 2016). 

Reading a PDF document on small screen is hard. Unless you've taken that into consideration, chances are I'm going to have to pinch, and zoom, and scroll upwards, downwards, and aideways just ot try and red it. and if you've used multiple columns??? Really???? Why would you intentionally make it that difficult for more than half of your audince to read your content? 

It gets worse when your email spans multiple pages. If you're not using a table of contents, or hyperlinks within the document - I can't easily find whats relevant to me. And I'm guessing out of your 3 pages - only 1 paragraph is either elevant, or applicable, or of interest to me. But instead - you're going to force me to read through everything just to ge to that one tidbit. 

In truth - I jus won't read it. I don't have to. My time is precious. Just liek yours. Just like you don't sit through an artcile if the first sentence or two doesn't grab you - your clients / or customers wont sit there and read through 4 pages of your email newsletter. 

TRacking, Analytics & Measurement

One of the core advantages of digital content is our ability to track, measure and learn about what's working, and what's not. If you send your email as a PDF attachment - you're just making things difficult for yourslef. Ask yourself:

How many people who read the email, opened the attachment? 
On average, how many pages of the newsletter did each reader read?
What was the most intersting pience od content within the email?
Which peice of content had the most shares?

Can you A/B test? Which healdine swork best? Which link text worked best?

With a PDF attachement, it's not quite so easy to track these mterics.
