<p class="p-intro">Did you know that HALF of all the emails you’re pushing out are being opened on a mobile device?</p>

That’s a 400% increase in mobile email opens since 2011. 400%!!! Not surprising when you think about it really, though. So, who gives a shit then?

Well, your audience does. 

A comprehensive study into email marketing by BlueHornet showed that 85% of consumer recipients would immediately delete an email if it was poorly optimised / designed for their mobile. Straight in the inbox. Straight out. Without even reading your offer. 

The same study showed a poorly designed email actually left 75% of recipients with  an overall negative impression of the brand itself. 

You see, customer expectations are growing. And rightfully so. 

And that means, we need to start thinking very seriously about how mobiles display emails, and how those recipients interact with them. 

###The Ever-Growing Device Landscape

Supposedly, there’s over a thousand different Android devices, then we have Windows, RIM (Blackberry), and iOS… thousands of devices, multiple screen sizes and all with their own little quirks: eg. the new Windows 8 doesn’t support MQs, old versions did. Nor does Gmail. iOS automatically resizes and enlarges any fonts under 13px, and the list goes on. 

If you’ve ever had the great fortune of delivering a large, responsive site whilst also needing to support ie6, ie7, and ie8 too with lots of interactive visual elements, responsive emails are even more fun! :p

###Understand Your Core Audience

But you need to remember, you can’t be everything to everyone. 

You need to understand your core audience, and how that relates to the business objectives. 

And rather than getting hung-up on device specifics, and delivering a super fancy responsive email that stacks on the mobile whilst extends out to a super 19-column grid layout on desktop, think about the user experience. 

What are you trying to get the recipient to do? 

What’s the goal? 

And then make that journey, as simple and easy as possible.

###Touch Me

If half of your audience is opening mails on a mobile device, don’t get too bogged down on what devices they’re using, or what screen size it is. The one underlying common factor is: touch. (And generally, a more  restricted viewing area). 

Space is precious.

With so many emails and offers, why should I spend the time pinching and zooming, and trying to fill in tiny little forms when one of the million other companies out there can make it nice and easy for me. It doesn’t matter what your offer was or is – at this point, your email has already pissed me off.

Every time I try and press the link I want to press, my fat finger clicks the little blue link right next to it. NOTE: My finger is NOT a stylus. It’s a finger. And no, it’s not particularly fat at all. But it still can’t click your tiny little link, squashed next to another link on this tiny little screen.  

You’d think my woes end there. But no. 

###Pissing Off the User

I click the wrong link, and allow myself to be directed to your landing page. And great I can see what I want on the page. And then a big fuckin’ pop-up comes up in the way. It’s so big, the little “x” that closes it spills off the screen. 

And no matter how hard I try to zoom in, or pinch out, or swipe across – it follows me, and resizes, and stays there, blocking my view. Blocking my screen.

No instead of “nurturing a relationship with your consumer”, or “selling” or whatever else you were trying to do: you’ve just pissed me off.

Good design is more than just looking pretty. It’s about the experience. 

###Ask yourself...

And if you’re designing for mobiles – stop, and think for a moment.

How will the user interact?

What do you want them to do?

How does this behaviour change on a mobile device?

How many taps (‘cos on a mobile, its about taps – not clicks!!!) are required to reach the desired outcome?

And most importantly of all, whether its an email, or a responsive website, make the clickable link a nice big button, with lots of space around it so I can actually “tap” it, ‘cos that’s what the link’s there for, no???
