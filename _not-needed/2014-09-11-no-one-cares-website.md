<p class="p-intro">So you've just spent the last few days fighting with your designer. Making the the logo that slight bit bigger. Getting that headline to stand out, to "pop"  off the page.</p> 

The last few weeks have been a battle, but its been totally worth it. 

Your website is finally live.

Sure it took way longer than first planned. 

Sure you spent way longer than planned. And it was hard convincing the designer to do what you wanted.

But it's here. 

And it's looking exactly the way you want it to look. 

Even you're mum said it looked great. 

But there's a problem.

It's been over a week now, and there's no new enquiries, no new leads, not even the tiniest pip from the telephone. 

You pick up the phone just to check it's still working. You hear the ring tone.  

You open your inbox. 

Nothing.

You post another twitter update, "Check out my new website". 

You post on Facebook again - "I've re-launched my website". Just to remind people.

A week later. Nothing.

"Why is no-one coming to the new website?"

###The Cold Hard Truth

The truth is... no one cares.

They don't care you've got twenty images that scroll past at lightning speed. The don't care your logo changes colour every second.

They don't care how much time you spent fighting with your designer bending his work to your particular requirements. They don't care about your mission statement. Or the fact you've posted on Facebook every hour  of every day for the past week. 

But wait...

I'm a developer - don't I build websites for a living? Shouldn't I be selling you the benefits of having a professionally designed website, and the glorious miracles that'll occur as a result of it?

You've heard a million times the importance of having a beautiful website. That it's the crux of your customers experience - the first impression of your business.  

Yes, and yes. But it's a little more deeper than that.

You see - the way a website looks is important. Within a split-second - they've making a judgement call about you, about your business. That first impression - that first second, will decide whether they'll spend another few seconds reading what you've got to say.

Because underneath all that shiny exterior, they'll see the content. The meat. the purpose of your site.

I've been working with websites now for a good few years. I've helped improve hundreds of websites. I've  worked with customers big and small, from one-man bands to big corporate multi-nationals with huge web teams, and even more stakeholders, and along the way, I've learnt a thing or two.

###"WIIFM?"

Visitors to your site DO care...

They care about themselves! 

They care about finding a solution to their problem! 

Almost universally, when someone searches the internet, they're looking for an answer. An answer to their question. 

When someone lands on your website, they want to know:

Do you provide the answer(s) to their question(s)?

Do you help them solve their own problem(s)?

Can you solve their problem(s) for them? 

So when you spent all that time debating on the number of pictures you wanted including in your site, did you actually stop to think about why that slider's there in the first place?

###Have a Purpose

Step back, and ask yourself - what is the purpose of this page? What do I want the visitor to do next?

Make it easy - clear, and simple. 

You're guiding the visitor. Do you want them to call you? If so, is the number clearly visible? Can they click it and the phone automatically starts ringing? Are your opening hours clearly visible?

Your site has a purpose. And that purpose should be very clear. Every page on your site exists for a reason. And that reason forms part of your whole site's purpose. 

So ask yourself: what's the purpose of your site?
