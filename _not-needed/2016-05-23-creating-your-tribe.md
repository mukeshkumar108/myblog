<p class="p-intro">Seth Godin on Tim Ferriss's Podcast - inbetweenisode.</p>

tribe already exists. 

nike didnt create running tribe. harley didnt create the 1 percent. they already existed.

you find the tribe. you can lead the tribe. you can facilitate the tribe. you can serve the tribe. 

you're not creating the tribe.

as the saying goes - your vibe attracts your tribe.
