Whther you're designing a website, an app, an ebook,a newsletter, an infographic or any other piece of content, the visual aspect matters.

We do judge a book by its cover.

the design can either present the infomration you're conveying in a easy to read, digestible format, or it can be hidden amongst poor design decisions - making it hard to read, hard to convert, and hard to provide any real value to its intended audience.

a bad design just looks bad. It amkes you look unprofessional, amateur.

Unfortunately - those closest to you will not always be honest in therir reviews. They don;t want to hury your feelings.

Every one likes to think they've got a creative designer, deep within themselves. The reality is that's not always the case. And that's ok. Not everyone has your unique gifts & talents. And likewise, you don't always ahre another's gifts & talents. 

And yes, I'm of the firm belief, that we can as individuals with commitment, and practice, devleop our skills. But not everyone has a natural ability as certain things. And this is often the case with design.

So you've invested a few hours in to creating a masterpiece. You've invested time & effort. You're emotionally invested. And you're biased. To yo it looks gfreat. But in reality - it looks shit. But you can't see that.

When you send that content out into the world, it makes you look shit. It makes your business look like an amateur. It's obvious when someones invested in design, or when they've had a go themselces. How seriously cna someone take you if you're selling a service, hoping people invest money in you as a provider, when obviously you're so averse to investing in someone else's skills? 

I get it - sometimes we gotta do what we gotta do. In the early stages of growth - we need to careful where we allocate reosurcez. Where we spend money. And sometimes, we've gotta roll up our sleeves and get dirty and do it ourself.

Well, the good thing is there's lots of resources out there to help you. But with so many options, it can be overwhelming. 

So here's some basic tips to ensure your ocntent stands out, and design helps.

1. ###Form follows function

What's the intended purpose? Make sure your design doesn't get in the way

2. ###white space is good

Let the content stand out and pseka for itslef

3. ###Don't use more than 2 fonts

Jst because you have access to 100's of fonts, doesn't mean you have to use them. Choose two - and stick with htem. One for headlines, and one for body copy. 

4. ###Images should support the content

Use images which support the content. Don't confuse people with random images just because they look nice to you. Every element should serve a purpose.

5. ###Focus on readability

90% of design is typography. Make sure it's easy for people to read. Use a vertical rhythm - amke sure there's a good line height. makes reading easier.

Leading - margins underneath the main headline. Sub headlines may need different leading. Space and margins give the content room to breathe - make it easier on our eyes - for our brains to deciphr the content. If you squicsh it without it, it makes it very difficult to read.
