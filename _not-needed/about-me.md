<p class="p-intro">'T is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. My name's Mukesh, and I'm the face behind this blog.</p>

I've been meaning to blog and develop a writing habit for years now. Excuse after excuse has held me back. But no more...

This is a simple blog built upon the awesome static site generator - [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - a place for me to share my thoughts, my learnings, and document my adventures in the front-end and navigating the ever-changing digital landscape.
