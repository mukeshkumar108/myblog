<p class="p-intro">Netlfix came along and completely changed the business model of Blockbuster. amazon did the same for the traditional bookstores. As is Uber for the taxi business.</p>

Maybe you've heard it mentioned in a few places. Maybe someone, or a few people, have recommended it to you. 

Maybe  - it's about a topic you're interested in, and want to learn more about that topic.

In conversation, a friend of mine mentioned a book they were thinking of buying. 

A week later - I asked whether they bought.

They hadn't.

He went on to tell me how we spent a few hours reading online reviews - amazon, goodreads, and some other online reviews.

The reviews were overall positive. But now, they were going to wait and see if the book was available for cheaper at their local bookstore. 

So in debating whether to spend less than £10 on a book, they had spent already 2 hours of their time, and with the intention of spending another hour or so to make the purchase.

What the fuck?

Honestly - ask yourself what is your time worth? 

I'm betting you're worth more than £10/hour. Spending 3 hours making a decision you've just spent £30. Whether you save £3 is irrelevant.

Just buy the fucking book. Spend that 3 hours reading the book.

Books are probably the most value-packed thing oyu cna buy. Generally, the author has invested hundreds of hours of their research, their knowledge, their expertise and packaged it for you in a very affordable, very easy to consume manner.

Even if you take one thing from that book that you can apply to your life - that changes your thinking, that affects you... whatever you/ve spent on that book has been rewarded a thousand-fold.

So stop wasting your cognitive resources making ridiculous decisions - if it's an affordable purchase - just make it. 

Give hte book a change - read 50 - 70 pages. If you can't get in to it - give it to a charity shop. Or sell it online. Amazon / ebay - all make it pretty easy and brand new book will probably fetch mored than half of what you';ve paid for it.

And you've saved yourself a couple of hours.

So remember - if you find yourself asking the question - shoul I buy this book - the answer is always, -yes - just buy the damn book!
