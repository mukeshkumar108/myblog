Well it all started when I was at school – and since I didn’t receive any pocket money, I teamed up with this other ‘geek’ [note: back then, geeks weren’t considered cool!] who always had the latest PC games (think Doom 3D, Wolfenstein), and we started selling bootleg copies of these games (remember the old 3.5″ floppies?) to make some money. Then I remember the Exorcist being re-released – there was all this hoo-hah since it had been banned for so long, and so when another colleague obtained a copy, I obviously borrowed it, made several copies and sold them. There were other films, and other games, but to be honest, making money wasn’t ever the intention: it was just having the freedom to visit the tuck-shop when I wanted, and to buy what I wanted.

Over the years, this resourcefulness didn’t always keep me on the “straight and narrow” path, but certainly led to some fantastic life lessons and adventures. However, I did, at times, dip my toes in the ‘legitimate’ side of business affairs too… at about 19, I started visiting ‘Catalogue Return’ warehouses, buying stock, and re-selling at car-boots and on eBay. And that’s really where this journey began. Because I started noticing the better adverts resulted in better sales

I taught myself HTML (back then it was all tables, and it was thanks to a pirated copy of ‘Dreamweaver’ too)… but I started understanding the importance of ‘sales copy’ and ‘headlines’, as well as ‘keywords’, and the impact ‘good design’ could have on the whole experience. Back then, eBay was easy. And I remember vividly; I had bought a collection of buggies – there was 5 in total from this warehouse. 3 were basically ‘as new’, 1 was ‘ok’ and the ‘3rd’ was obviously second-hand. The latter two came with me on my weekly car-boot pitch, whilst the the other 3 were listed on eBay. On bids only, I sold each of these buggies on eBay for £120 (I paid £50 incl. VAT for the lot)… £360 from 3 buggies, on a £50 outlay – not bad, huh?!

My years have been interspersed with ‘moments of resourcefulness’ – I remember another time, when there was a very successful PG Tips advert, with a monkey bearing a now infamous slogan on his t-shirt. I saw the popularity of the adert, and on the back of that, launched an eBay business selling t-shirts which brought in on average about £800/week. All drop-shipped. All I had to do, was process orders and answer emails. Again, my attention span lasted for about 3 months, until I got bored, and went on holiday.

All of these little forays exposed me to the world of ‘internet marketing’, and from there I discovered ‘web design’.

Now, I’m a 30-year old professional. I run a little digital agency. But I still have this huge passion for learning. (Perhaps it’s my short attention span?!?) I’m always attending this meetup, or webinar, or taking this class or that class (as I’ve recently discovered MOOCs)…

One thing I do want to do is, get better at writing. What better way than to blog – practice makes perfect, hey?! Hopefully, this blog is where I can talk about all things business related, where I can give the impression of being a professional. My other blog, I’m going to keep for personal ramblings.

Well, I’ve finally done it. I made my intention public. Hopefully I’ll stick to it!
